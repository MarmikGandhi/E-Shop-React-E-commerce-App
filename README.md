# 🛒 E-Shop – React E-commerce App

This is a responsive, single-page e-commerce application built using **React.js**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **React Router**. It allows users to browse products, view details, manage a cart, and simulate a checkout process. The project fetches real product data from the [Fake Store API](https://fakestoreapi.com/).

> ✅ **This project was developed as part of my internship to demonstrate real-world frontend development and React-based state management.**
